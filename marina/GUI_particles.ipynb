For each of these 3 layers the $z$-axis is pointing up. For the ambient layer, the $z=0.0$ coordinate corresponds to the interface between ambient and a middle layer. To place a particle in the air layer, normally positive values $z>=0.0$ should be used. For **any other layer** $z=0.0$ corresponds to the top interface. To place a particle in one of such layers, normally negative values $z<=0.0$ should be used. \n",
